## Introduction
    
Mediscale tracks user's movement to provide important stats and triggers an alarm to inform all the saved contacts during a fall injury. The program primarily focuses 
on tracking users movement, but also showcases the following HMS kits capibilities.

## What You Will Create

In this code lab, you will create a MediScale Health project and use the APIs of Location, Map, Site and ML kits, you can explore the following processes in the MediScale Health project.

*	Detect if user has a fall injury
*	Obtain weather and AQI based on location
*	Help users analyze various health parameters like BMI and users activity such as walking and running
*	Allow users to activate SOS trigger function to alert the saved contacts

## What You Will Learn

In this code lab, you will learn how to:
*	Map Kit
*	Location Kit
*	Site Kit
